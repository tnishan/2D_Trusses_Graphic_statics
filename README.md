# 2D_Trusses_Graphic_statics
The basic objective of this project is to explore topology, shape and size optimization of 2D trusses using Graphic Statics as an alternate system for design.

The project was created in Rhino-Grasshopper environment with solver programmed in grasshopper using Ironpython and C in some instances.
For optimization (minimization ) Galapagos ( Genetic Algorithm function available within Grasshopper ) was used.

## Abstract of the project.
Truss has been used as a structural system since the past. For economic design of truss, various methods have been developed and used. The field is in continuous development and newer methods are being developed. With the rapid development of computational power, newer algorithms are being developed so that the optimization process could be done by the usage of sophisticated computers available nowadays. In this study, we explored some of the aspect of the optimization of roof truss using graphic statics along with genetic algorithm. Optimization of truss is done by using load path as objective function which is product of line of force diagrams with line of form diagrams. Several parameters of truss are investigated to get the intuitive insight in several types of truss used predominantly. Importance of topology optimization for the ultimate optimized truss is underscored in the study.
